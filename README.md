# alb2psql

A simple utility to pull AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) request logs, and load them into a local PostgreSQL database for exploration/investigation.

> Note: If you're doing this alot, setting up a hosted workflow to automatically load ALB Logs -> Redshift/Postgres (optionally with Lambda), will be a much better option, and I suggest you consider it.
